#Example of a user
type: user
# Some users may change id during lifetime (non-logged-in to loggedin).
# MonkeyId should be their first ever id, so their experiments are consistent

# Variables overrides for this specific user
variables:
  - Variable1: False
# To simulate the last experiments for a user we would need to know as well information about them (e.g last country)
# This is specially required if we are accessing from another service/backend and we want to calculate the latest experiments for the user
